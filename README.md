3. Casino Number Guessing Game
The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the playerâ€™s luck and 
knowledge. The player needs to guess a random number generated by the 
computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money. 
The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program 
implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types. It also uses other 
features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. 
Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic 
operations and other data structures.

Programming(OOPS), Data Structures, Input/Output Streams, Memory
